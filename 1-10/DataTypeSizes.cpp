/*
You have been given a job as a programmer on a Cyborg supercomputer.
In order to accomplish some calculations, you need to know how many bytes
the following data types use: char, int, float, and double. You do not
have any manuals, so you canâ€™t look up this information. Write a
program that will determine the amount of memory used by these types
and display the information on the screen.
