/*
  In the United States, land is often measured in
  square feet. In many other countries it is measured
  in square meters. One acre of land is equivalent to
  43,560 square feet. A square meter is equivalent to
  10.7639 square feet. Write a program that computes
  and displays the number of square feet and the number
  of square meters ¼ in acre of land. Hint: Because a
  square meter is larger than a square foot, there will
  be fewer square meters in ¼ acre than there are
  square feet.
